Overview of Social Engineering
What is social engineering?
I once asked this question to a group of security enthusiasts and I was
shocked at the answers I received:
“Social engineering is lying to people to get information.”
“Social engineering is being a good actor.”“Social engineering is knowing how to get stuff for free.”
Wikipedia defines it as “the act of manipulating people into performing
actions or divulging confidential information. While similar to a confidence
trick or simple fraud, the term typically applies to trickery or deception for the
purpose of information gathering, fraud, or computer system access; in most
cases the attacker never comes face-to-face with the victim.”
Although it has been given a bad name by the plethora of “free pizza,” “free
coffee,” and “how to pick up chicks” sites, aspects of social engineering
actually touch many parts of daily life.
Webster’s Dictionary defines social as “of or pertaining to the life, welfare,
and relations of human beings in a community.” It also defines engineering
as “the art or science of making practical application of the knowledge of
pure sciences, as physics or chemistry, as in the construction of engines,
bridges, buildings, mines, ships, and chemical plants or skillful or artful
contrivance; maneuvering.”
Combining those two definitions you can easily see that social
engineering is the art or better yet, science, of skillfully maneuvering human
beings to take action in some aspect of their lives.
This definition broadens the horizons of social engineers everywhere.
Social engineering is used in everyday life in the way children get their
parents to give in to their demands. It is used in the way teachers interact
with their students, in the way doctors, lawyers, or psychologists obtain
information from their patients or clients. It is definitely used in law
enforcement, and in dating—it is truly used in every human interaction from
babies to politicians and everyone in between.
