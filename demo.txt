Moreover, I discuss what can be learned from his attack vectors as well as
how they can be used today. I discuss some personal accounts and dissect
them, as well.
What social engineering guide would be complete without discussing
some of the ways you can mitigate these attacks? The appendix provides
this information. I answer some common questions on mitigation and give
some excellent tips to help secure you and your organization against these
malicious attacks.
The preceding overview is just a taste of what is to come. I truly hope you
enjoy reading this book as much as I have enjoyed writing it. Social
engineering is a passion for me. I do believe there are certain traits, whether
learned or inherent, that can make someone a great social engineer. I also
subscribe to the belief that with enough time and energy anyone can learn
the different aspects of social engineering and then practice these skills to
become a proficient social engineer.
The principles in this book are not new; there is no mind-blowing
technology that you will see that will change the face of security forever.
There are no magic pills. As a matter of fact, the principles have been around
for as long as people have. What this book does do is combine all of these
skills in one location. It does give you clear direction on how to practice these
skills as well as examples of real-life situations where they are used. All of
this information can help you gain a true sense of understanding the topics
discussed.
The best place to start is with the basics, by answering one fundamental
question: “What is social engineering?”
